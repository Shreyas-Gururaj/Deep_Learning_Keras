## Learnings

* Mean squared error (MSE) is a good loss function for regression.
* Instead of accuracy, we can use mean absolute error (MAE) as an evaluation metric.
* When input features have different ranges, we need to normalize them by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
* The test data needs to be normalized with the mean and standard deviation of the training data.
* With little data, use few layers with few neurons, to prevent overfitting.
