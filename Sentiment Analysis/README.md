## Learnings
* Lots of work goes into preprocessing data.
* Stacks of dense relu layers for intermediate hidden layers.
* For binary classification, output layer should be a single sigmoid unit.
* For binary classification, binary crossentropy loss function should be used.
* rmsprop is often good choice for an optimizer.
* Use validation set, and avoid overfitting.
